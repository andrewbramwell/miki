            <p>
                Discover the ancient art of Thai massage at Aroma Thai Massage & Spa in Girona, Spain. Also known as Nuad Thai or Thai yoga massage, this traditional healing practice originated in Thailand and offers a unique approach to bodywork. By combining acupressure, assisted yoga postures, and passive stretching, Thai massage aims to restore balance and alleviate discomfort by addressing blocked or imbalanced energy pathways called "sen lines" in the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                During your Thai massage session, our skilled practitioners will utilize their hands, thumbs, elbows, knees, and feet to apply rhythmic pressure along the sen lines. Through fluid movements, gentle rocking motions, and incorporated stretches, tension is released, promoting flexibility, joint mobility, and deep relaxation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thai massage has gained worldwide recognition due to its effectiveness and popularity. It is sought after by individuals looking to relieve muscle tension, alleviate stress-related symptoms, reduce stiffness, and combat general fatigue. Whether you seek therapeutic treatment or a rejuvenating experience, Thai massage offers a holistic approach to wellness, combining the benefits of acupressure, yoga, and meditation in a single session.
